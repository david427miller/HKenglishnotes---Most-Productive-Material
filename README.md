Aristotle’s Concept of Plot in Poetics


Aristotle pays much attention to the study of the essential nature, structure, and integral elements of a perfect tragic plot. The plot is the systematic organization of events in a tragedy. In this way, the plot is comprised of the crux of the action, which is the real object of the tragedy. He goes to the extent of claiming the superiority of plot over character:
     “There can be a tragedy without a character but none without a plot.”
Moreover, the plot must be natural rather than artless.

The word ‘poet’ is taken from the Greek language which means a ‘maker’. According to Aristotle, the poet is a ‘maker’ not because he writes verses, but because he creates plots. Furthermore, he asserts that the tales taken from mythology, history, or legendary incidents must be given priority because they are familiar and easy to comprehend. Only related situations should be selected and these should be ‘serious’, possibly to evoke the tragic catharsis of the emotions of pity and fear.

Aristotle thinks that the tragic plot must be complete and coherent. By ‘complete’ he refers that the plot must have a proper and organized beginning, middle, and end. The beginning must not be emerged out of some earlier event. Rather, it must be logical and clear. The Greeks commonly gave the history of the events through the Prologue. The middle is based on a situation that has occurred before, and which is followed by a downfall. The end follows consequently but is not followed by any further situation. It is in contrast with the modern endings on ‘cliffhangers.’

Aristotle also stresses the magnitude of the plot. It should be neither too minute nor too extensive. He explains that if it is too large, the beginning would be forgotten before the end. And if it is too small, its various parts will not be recognizable from each other. Thus, the magnitude involves proper structure and proportion.

Aristotle regards the plot of a tragedy as an organic whole, which has organic unity of action. It means that every event has a rational, relevant, and logical link with the complete action. Aristotle connects the unity of the plot with probability and necessity. He says:

 “It is not the function of the poet to relate what has happened but what is possible according to the law of probability or necessity.”

He sums it up by saying that a probable or reasonable impossibility is given preference to the unconvincing and irrational possibility.

Aristotle defines a tragedy as an imitation of a ‘serious action’. He adds that its ultimate purpose is to arouse pity and fear that brings catharsis to these emotions. It implies that the plot must be a catastrophic one. Aristotle dismisses fortunate plots for the tragedy because there is no possibility to arouse the proper tragic emotions of pity and fear in such a plot.

Aristotle divides plots into three kinds. A simple plot does not involve any Perepetia (Reversal of Fortune) and Anagnorisis (Discovery). According to Aristotle, a perfect complex tragic plot must contain these two features. Peripeteia means being blind to the truth, while Anagnorisis is the discovery of that truth through a cause-and-effect sequence of circumstances.

Aristotle asserts that while reaching the ending or denouement, resolving the plot should be done naturally and rationally. The poet must avoid using unpredictable practices or the ‘marvelous’ elements such as chance and supernatural interferences. Aristotle regards Poetic Justice as an unnecessary element. Likewise, he also disapproves of Tragi-comedy.

To conclude, Aristotle conceives a plot of being an organic whole and coherent. The different events must be interconnected with a sort of crafty logic. He sums it up by saying that plot is the ‘soul of tragedy’.
